# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing supply chain delivery performance using fulfillment metrics.  
An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to track OT, IF, and OTIF indicators.  
The analysis compares performance across cities, customers, and products.  
The goal is to identify delivery gaps and support data-driven improvements.

## 📌 Project Objective
To evaluate **on-time and in-full delivery performance** and highlight operational bottlenecks affecting service levels.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked
- **OT %** – On-Time Delivery
- **IF %** – In-Full Delivery
- **OTIF %** – On-Time In-Full
- **VOFR %** – Volume Fill Rate
- **LIFR %** – Line Fill Rate

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Delivery performance comparison by **city**
- On-time vs delayed order analysis
- Average delivery delay (in days)
- Customer-wise and product-wise delay insights
- Identification of **top delay-prone customers and products**
- Trend analysis of fulfillment metrics over time

---

## 📈 Insights Generated
- Significant gaps observed between **actual vs target OTIF performance**
- Certain cities consistently underperform on delivery timelines
- A small set of customers and products contribute to a large share of delays
- Average delivery delay highlights opportunities for process improvement

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development & visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and measures  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation  
- **SQL** – Data extraction and transformation  

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor supply chain service levels in real time
- Identify delay drivers quickly
- Support data-driven decisions to improve delivery performance

---


## ✅ Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in analyzing supply chain performance using real-world business metrics. By tracking OT, IF, and OTIF indicators, the dashboard highlights delivery inefficiencies and identifies key cities, customers, and products contributing to delays. The insights generated can support data-driven decision-making and help improve overall service levels and operational efficiency.
