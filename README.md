# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes **supply chain delivery performance** using key fulfillment metrics to identify delays, service gaps, and improvement opportunities across cities, customers, and products.

---

## 📌 Project Objective
To evaluate **on-time and in-full delivery performance** and highlight operational bottlenecks affecting service levels.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked
- **OT %** – On-Time Delivery
- **IF %** – In-Full Delivery
- **OTIF %** – On-Time In-Full
- **VOFR %** – Volume Fill Rate
- **LIFR %** – Line Fill Rate

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Delivery performance comparison by **city**
- On-time vs delayed order analysis
- Average delivery delay (in days)
- Customer-wise and product-wise delay insights
- Identification of **top delay-prone customers and products**
- Trend analysis of fulfillment metrics over time

---

## 📈 Insights Generated
- Significant gaps observed between **actual vs target OTIF performance**
- Certain cities consistently underperform on delivery timelines
- A small set of customers and products contribute to a large share of delays
- Average delivery delay highlights opportunities for process improvement

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard development & visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and measures  
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preparation  
- **SQL** – Data extraction and transformation  

---

## 🎯 Outcome
This dashboard enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor supply chain service levels in real time
- Identify delay drivers quickly
- Support data-driven decisions to improve delivery performance
